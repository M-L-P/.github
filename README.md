The beginning is as beautiful as the head of a phoenix, while the ending is as powerful as the tail of a leopard.<br/>
The middle is like pork, with fat and lean meat.<br/>
Powering on, the Graphical Interface before entering the Operating System is quite pretty, with you having a good mood;<br/>
Working, it provides the information you need or spams you disgust;<br/>
Shutting down, the screen quickly turns black and extinguished, with you saving time.<br/>
